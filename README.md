# Weather-Air-Quality
This project showcases an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that combines weather and air quality data for a selected city over a specified period. The data is fetched from external APIs, cleaned and processed, then loaded into a PostgreSQL database. The objective is to create a structured, clean dataset for subsequent analysis or reporting.
